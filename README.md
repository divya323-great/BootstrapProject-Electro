Electro – Electrical Appliances Website
Welcome to Electro, a modern, responsive website for an electrical appliances company. This project is designed to showcase products, collect customer inquiries, and provide company information in a clean, user-friendly format.

Features
1. Responsive Design
Built with Bootstrap 4.6, Electro adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

2. Custom Branding
The site uses a custom logo and the unique "TwistJelly" font for a distinctive brand identity. The color palette is consistent throughout, giving a professional look.

3. Navigation Bar
A sticky navigation bar provides quick access to the Home and Contact pages, along with a prominent call-to-action phone number.

4. Hero Banner with Quote Form
The homepage features a bold banner with a free quote form. Visitors can submit their name, email, phone, and zip code to request a quote. The form is validated and connected to Google Sheets via a Google Apps Script, so all submissions are automatically saved for easy follow-up.

5. Product Highlights
Three key selling points are presented in card format:

Safe & Easy To Use

A section highlights the company’s value proposition, encouraging users to request a quote.

A photo gallery allows users to view images in a lightbox modal, powered by Ekko Lightbox for a smooth, interactive experience.

10. Scroll-to-Top Button
A floating button lets users quickly scroll back to the top of the page.

11. Animations
AOS (Animate On Scroll) library is integrated for subtle fade and slide animations as users scroll through the site.

12. Contact Page
A dedicated contact page provides phone numbers, email addresses, and the office location (with an embedded Google Map) for easy customer access.

13. Social Media Links
Footer includes links to Facebook and Instagram, encouraging visitors to connect on social platforms.
